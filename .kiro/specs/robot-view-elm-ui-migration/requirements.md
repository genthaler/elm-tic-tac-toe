# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The RobotGame.View module currently uses a hybrid approach combining HTML, CSS, and elm-ui for rendering the robot grid game interface. This creates maintenance challenges and inconsistencies with the rest of the application, which primarily uses elm-ui for UI components. The TicTacToe.View module serves as an excellent example of clean elm-ui implementation. This migration will refactor RobotGame.View to use pure elm-ui patterns, improving code maintainability, consistency, and reducing the reliance on custom CSS.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the RobotGame.View module to use pure elm-ui patterns like TicTacToe.View, so that the codebase is consistent and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the RobotGame.View module is refactored THEN the system SHALL use Element and elm-ui functions exclusively for layout and styling
2. WHEN the view is rendered THEN the system SHALL eliminate the need for custom CSS styles and HTML.node usage
3. WHEN the refactored view is implemented THEN the system SHALL follow the same structural patterns as TicTacToe.View
4. WHEN elm-ui is used THEN the system SHALL maintain the same visual appearance and functionality as the current implementation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the robot grid to be rendered using elm-ui layout functions, so that it integrates seamlessly with the application's design system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the grid is rendered THEN the system SHALL use Element.column and Element.row for grid layout instead of HTML tables or CSS grid
2. WHEN grid cells are displayed THEN the system SHALL use Element.el with Background.color and Border properties for styling
3. WHEN the robot is positioned THEN the system SHALL use elm-ui positioning and styling instead of absolute positioning or CSS transforms
4. WHEN the grid is responsive THEN the system SHALL use elm-ui responsive utilities and the existing Theme.Responsive module

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the robot visualization to use elm-ui and SVG patterns consistent with TicTacToe.View, so that the robot rendering is maintainable and theme-aware.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the robot is displayed THEN the system SHALL use Element.html with SVG for the robot icon similar to TicTacToe's player symbols
2. WHEN the robot faces different directions THEN the system SHALL use SVG transforms for rotation instead of CSS animations
3. WHEN the robot is themed THEN the system SHALL use theme colors from the BaseTheme type for consistent appearance
4. WHEN the robot is rendered THEN the system SHALL maintain the directional arrow indicator using SVG paths

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the control buttons to use elm-ui button patterns like TicTacToe.View, so that they are consistent with the application's interaction design.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN control buttons are rendered THEN the system SHALL use Element.Input.button or Element.el with Element.Events.onClick
2. WHEN buttons are styled THEN the system SHALL use elm-ui attributes like Background.color, Element.Border, and Element.padding
3. WHEN buttons have hover states THEN the system SHALL use Element.mouseOver instead of CSS hover selectors
4. WHEN buttons are disabled THEN the system SHALL use elm-ui conditional attributes instead of CSS disabled states

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want animations and transitions to be handled through elm-ui and minimal CSS, so that the animation system is simplified and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN animations are needed THEN the system SHALL minimize CSS animations and prefer elm-ui state-based visual changes
2. WHEN the robot moves THEN the system SHALL use elm-ui conditional styling based on AnimationState instead of CSS classes
3. WHEN visual feedback is provided THEN the system SHALL use elm-ui color and styling changes instead of complex CSS animations
4. WHEN transitions are required THEN the system SHALL use simple CSS transitions only for essential animations that cannot be achieved with elm-ui

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the header and navigation elements to follow TicTacToe.View patterns, so that the user interface is consistent across game modules.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game header is rendered THEN the system SHALL use the same Element.row layout pattern as TicTacToe.View
2. WHEN the back button is displayed THEN the system SHALL use the same styling and positioning as TicTacToe's backToHomeButton
3. WHEN the title is shown THEN the system SHALL use consistent typography and spacing with TicTacToe.View
4. WHEN theme controls are added THEN the system SHALL follow the same icon and interaction patterns as TicTacToe.View

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want the migrated view to maintain all existing functionality and visual appearance, so that the user experience remains unchanged.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the system SHALL preserve all existing game functionality including movement, rotation, and keyboard controls
2. WHEN the new view is displayed THEN the system SHALL maintain the same visual layout, colors, and spacing as the original implementation
3. WHEN animations occur THEN the system SHALL provide equivalent visual feedback for robot movement, rotation, and blocked actions
4. WHEN responsive design is applied THEN the system SHALL maintain the same responsive behavior across different screen sizes
5. WHEN accessibility features are used THEN the system SHALL preserve all ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, and screen reader support
