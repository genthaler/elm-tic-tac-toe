# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds elm-review to the Elm Tic-Tac-Toe project to provide automated code quality analysis and linting. elm-review is a static analysis tool for Elm that helps catch potential issues, enforce coding standards, and suggest improvements to make the codebase more maintainable and consistent.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want elm-review integrated into the project so that I can automatically detect code quality issues and maintain consistent coding standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN elm-review is installed THEN it SHALL be available as a development dependency
2. WHEN elm-review is configured THEN it SHALL use a sensible default ruleset appropriate for the project
3. WHEN elm-review is run THEN it SHALL analyze all Elm source files in src/ and tests/ directories
4. WHEN elm-review finds issues THEN it SHALL provide clear, actionable feedback with file locations and descriptions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want elm-review to be easily runnable via npm scripts so that it integrates smoothly with the existing development workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run `npm run review` THEN elm-review SHALL analyze the codebase and report any issues
2. WHEN I run `npm run review:fix` THEN elm-review SHALL automatically fix issues that can be safely auto-fixed
3. WHEN I run `npm run review:perf` THEN elm-review SHALL provide performance benchmarking information
4. WHEN I run `npm run review:clean` THEN elm-review SHALL analyze only source code excluding test directories
5. WHEN I run `npm run review:ci` THEN elm-review SHALL provide CI-friendly JSON output without colors
6. WHEN elm-review is run THEN it SHALL exit with appropriate status codes (0 for success, non-zero for issues found)
7. WHEN elm-review runs THEN it SHALL complete in a reasonable time (under 10 seconds for this project size)

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want elm-review to be integrated into the testing workflow so that code quality checks are enforced consistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests are run THEN elm-review SHALL be executed as part of the quality assurance process
2. WHEN elm-review finds critical issues THEN the overall test suite SHALL fail
3. WHEN elm-review passes THEN it SHALL not interfere with other test execution
4. WHEN CI/CD runs THEN elm-review SHALL be included in the automated checks

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want elm-review configured with rules that are appropriate for this project so that it provides valuable feedback without being overly restrictive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN elm-review is configured THEN it SHALL include comprehensive rules for detecting unused code (variables, parameters, imports, exports, modules, dependencies, patterns, custom type constructors)
2. WHEN elm-review is configured THEN it SHALL include rules for simplifying code patterns and suggesting more idiomatic Elm
3. WHEN elm-review is configured THEN it SHALL include rules for preventing debug code in production (Debug.log, TODO comments)
4. WHEN elm-review is configured THEN it SHALL include rules for enforcing good module practices (explicit exports, type annotations, documentation)
5. WHEN elm-review is configured THEN it SHALL include rules for code quality (confusing operators, premature let computation, simple let bodies)
6. WHEN elm-review is configured THEN it SHALL have relaxed rules for test directories to avoid unnecessary restrictions
7. WHEN elm-review is configured THEN it SHALL be easily customizable for future rule additions or modifications
8. WHEN elm-review is configured THEN it SHALL order rules from fastest to slowest for optimal performance
