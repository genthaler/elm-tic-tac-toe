# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a tic-tac-toe game built with Elm that allows one human player to compete against a computer AI opponent. The game features a clean functional architecture, responsive design, and uses web workers to handle AI computations without blocking the main UI thread. The game supports both light and dark color schemes and provides visual feedback for game state and player turns.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a human player, I want to play tic-tac-toe against a computer opponent, so that I can enjoy a challenging single-player game experience.

2. WHEN the game starts THEN the system SHALL assign the human player as "X" and computer as "O"
3. WHEN the game starts THEN the system SHALL indicate that it's the human player's turn
4. WHEN it's the human player's turn THEN the system SHALL allow clicking on empty cells to make moves

5. WHEN no valid moves are available THEN the system SHALL handle the end game condition

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a player, I want the game to detect and announce win conditions, so that I know when the game ends and who won.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN three X's or O's are aligned horizontally THEN the system SHALL declare the corresponding player as winner
2. WHEN three X's or O's are aligned vertically THEN the system SHALL declare the corresponding player as winner

4. WHEN the board is full with no winner THEN the system SHALL declare the game as a draw
5. WHEN a game ends THEN the system SHALL display the result message clearly
6. WHEN a game ends THEN the system SHALL prevent further moves on the board

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a player, I want to be able to start a new game, so that I can play multiple rounds without refreshing the page.

#### Acceptance Criteria

3. WHEN the game is reset THEN the system SHALL set the game state back to human player's turn
4. WHEN the game is reset THEN the system SHALL maintain the current color scheme setting
5. WHEN the game is reset THEN the system SHALL be ready for a new game immediately

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a player, I want visual feedback about the current game state, so that I always know what's happening in the game.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN the computer is calculating THEN the system SHALL display "Player O's thinking"
3. WHEN a player wins THEN the system SHALL display "Player X wins!" or "Player O wins!"
4. WHEN the game ends in a draw THEN the system SHALL display "Game ended in a draw!"
5. WHEN an error occurs THEN the system SHALL display the error message clearly

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a player, I want to customize the visual appearance, so that I can play in my preferred color scheme.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN the browser window is resized THEN the system SHALL adjust the layout accordingly
3. WHEN the computer calculates moves THEN the system SHALL use a web worker to prevent UI blocking
4. WHEN the AI is thinking THEN the system SHALL keep the UI responsive for other interactions
5. WHEN running on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL provide touch-friendly cell sizes and interactions

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a component style guide, so that I can showcase and test individual UI components in isolation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running the style guide THEN the system SHALL display a book interface with component chapters
2. WHEN viewing the style guide THEN the system SHALL show individual player symbols (X and O) as both SVG and string representations
