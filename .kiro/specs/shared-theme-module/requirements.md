# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves extracting the theme functionality from both the TicTacToe and RobotGame modules into a shared theme submodule under the root directory. Currently, both games have duplicated theme-related code including ColorScheme types, Theme type aliases, responsive design utilities, and theme selection logic. This refactoring will eliminate code duplication, improve maintainability, and provide a consistent theming system across all games in the project.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a shared theme module so that I can maintain consistent theming across all games without code duplication.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I examine the codebase THEN there SHALL be a single `Theme` module under the root `src/` directory
2. WHEN I look at the shared theme module THEN it SHALL contain the `ColorScheme` type definition with Light and Dark variants
3. WHEN I examine the theme module THEN it SHALL provide theme type aliases that can be used by both games
4. WHEN I check the theme module THEN it SHALL include responsive design utilities (screen size detection, responsive sizing functions)
5. WHEN I review the module THEN it SHALL provide theme selection functions that return appropriate theme configurations

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want both games to use the shared theme module so that theming logic is centralized and consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I examine the TicTacToe View module THEN it SHALL import and use the shared theme module instead of defining its own theme types
2. WHEN I examine the RobotGame View module THEN it SHALL import and use the shared theme module instead of defining its own theme types
3. WHEN I check both game models THEN they SHALL import the ColorScheme type from the shared theme module
4. WHEN I review both games THEN they SHALL use the shared responsive design utilities instead of their own implementations
5. WHEN I test both games THEN they SHALL maintain their existing visual appearance and functionality

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the shared theme module to support game-specific customizations so that each game can have its unique visual identity while sharing common infrastructure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I examine the shared theme module THEN it SHALL provide a base theme structure that can be extended by individual games
2. WHEN I look at game-specific theme implementations THEN they SHALL be able to define their own color palettes while using shared responsive utilities
3. WHEN I check the theme module THEN it SHALL support both common theme properties (background, text colors) and game-specific properties
4. WHEN I review the implementation THEN each game SHALL be able to override specific theme properties while inheriting common ones
5. WHEN I test theme switching THEN both games SHALL continue to support light/dark mode switching with their respective visual styles

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive tests for the shared theme module so that I can ensure reliability and prevent regressions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I examine the test suite THEN there SHALL be tests for the shared theme module covering ColorScheme functionality
2. WHEN I check the tests THEN they SHALL verify responsive design utilities work correctly across different screen sizes
3. WHEN I review the test coverage THEN it SHALL include tests for theme selection and configuration functions
4. WHEN I run the existing game tests THEN they SHALL continue to pass without modification after the refactoring
5. WHEN I examine the test structure THEN it SHALL include integration tests verifying both games work correctly with the shared theme module

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper JSON encoding/decoding support in the shared theme module so that theme preferences can be persisted and restored.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I examine the shared theme module THEN it SHALL provide JSON encoders and decoders for the ColorScheme type
2. WHEN I check the implementation THEN the JSON encoding SHALL be compatible with the existing format used by both games
3. WHEN I test serialization THEN ColorScheme values SHALL encode to and decode from JSON correctly
4. WHEN I verify backward compatibility THEN existing saved game states SHALL continue to load correctly with the new shared module
5. WHEN I examine error handling THEN JSON decoding SHALL handle invalid values gracefully with appropriate fallbacks

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Style Guide to be part of the Theme submodule so that theme documentation and examples are co-located with theme implementation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I examine the Theme submodule THEN it SHALL contain a StyleGuide module that showcases all theme components
2. WHEN I access the Style Guide THEN it SHALL display theme color swatches, typography examples, and component variations
3. WHEN I view the Style Guide THEN it SHALL demonstrate both light and dark theme variants for all components
4. WHEN I check the Style Guide implementation THEN it SHALL use the shared theme infrastructure to render examples
5. WHEN I navigate to the Style Guide THEN it SHALL be accessible from the main application navigation and maintain theme consistency
