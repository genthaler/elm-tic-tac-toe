# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will create a landing page for the Elm Tic-Tac-Toe application that provides users with a choice between playing the game or viewing the component style guide. The landing page will serve as the main entry point and use the same visual theme and framework as the existing tic-tac-toe game to maintain consistency.

## Requirements

3. WHEN I am in the game interface THEN the system SHALL provide a way to return to the landing page
4. WHEN the game interface loads THEN the system SHALL maintain the current color scheme preference

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user on the landing page, I want to be able to navigate to the theme style guide, so that I can explore the component library and design system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click the "View Style Guide" button THEN the system SHALL navigate to the Theme module's style guide interface
2. WHEN I am in the style guide interface THEN the system SHALL display theme color swatches, typography examples, and component variations from the Theme module
3. WHEN I am in the style guide interface THEN the system SHALL provide a way to return to the landing page
4. WHEN the style guide interface loads THEN the system SHALL maintain the current color scheme preference
5. WHEN I view the style guide THEN the system SHALL demonstrate both light and dark theme variants using the shared theme infrastructure

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the landing page to support theme switching, so that I can use my preferred color scheme across all parts of the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the landing page is displayed THEN the system SHALL show a theme toggle button (light/dark mode)
2. WHEN I click the theme toggle button THEN the system SHALL switch between light and dark themes immediately
3. WHEN I switch themes on the landing page THEN the system SHALL persist this preference when navigating to other sections
4. WHEN I return to the landing page from other sections THEN the system SHALL maintain my previously selected theme

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the landing page to integrate seamlessly with the existing build system, so that deployment and development workflows remain unchanged.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is built for production THEN the system SHALL include the landing page in the build output
2. WHEN the application is served THEN the system SHALL serve the landing page as the default route
3. WHEN using development mode THEN the system SHALL support hot reloading for landing page changes
