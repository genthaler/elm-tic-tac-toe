# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will implement hash-based URL routing for the Elm application, allowing users to navigate directly to specific pages via hash URLs and enabling browser back/forward navigation. Hash-based routing provides a simpler deployment model as it doesn't require server-side configuration for handling client-side routes, making it ideal for static hosting environments.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to navigate directly to specific pages using hash URLs, so that I can bookmark and share links to different sections of the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the root URL "/" or "/#/" THEN the system SHALL display the landing page
2. WHEN a user visits "/#/landing" THEN the system SHALL display the landing page
3. WHEN a user visits "/#/tic-tac-toe" THEN the system SHALL display the tic-tac-toe game page
4. WHEN a user visits "/#/robot-game" THEN the system SHALL display the robot grid game page
5. WHEN a user visits "/#/style-guide" THEN the system SHALL display the style guide page
6. WHEN a user visits an invalid hash URL THEN the system SHALL display the landing page as the default route

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to use browser navigation (back/forward buttons), so that I can navigate through the application history naturally.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to a different page THEN the browser hash URL SHALL update to reflect the current page
2. WHEN a user clicks the browser back button THEN the system SHALL navigate to the previous page using hash routing
3. WHEN a user clicks the browser forward button THEN the system SHALL navigate to the next page in history using hash routing
4. WHEN navigating via browser buttons THEN the application state SHALL be preserved appropriately
5. WHEN the hash changes THEN the system SHALL respond to hashchange events to update the current route

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to maintain game state when navigating between pages, so that I don't lose my progress when switching views.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates away from a game page THEN the game state SHALL be preserved
2. WHEN a user returns to a game page THEN the previous game state SHALL be restored
3. WHEN a user navigates between pages THEN the theme preference SHALL be maintained
4. WHEN a user refreshes the page THEN the current page SHALL be determined from the URL

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the routing system to be extensible, so that new pages can be easily added in the future.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adding a new page THEN the routing system SHALL require minimal changes to existing code
2. WHEN defining routes THEN the system SHALL use a centralized route definition
3. WHEN parsing hash URLs THEN the system SHALL handle route parsing reliably
4. WHEN generating hash URLs THEN the system SHALL provide helper functions for type-safe URL construction
5. WHEN implementing routing THEN the system SHALL follow established Elm routing patterns and best practices

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want navigation links to update the hash URL without full page reloads, so that the application feels responsive and maintains state.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN clicking navigation links THEN the system SHALL use hash-based navigation without page reloads
2. WHEN navigating between pages THEN the page SHALL not reload completely
3. WHEN the hash URL changes THEN only the relevant page content SHALL update
4. WHEN navigation occurs THEN the browser history SHALL be updated appropriately using hash routing

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the routing system to handle edge cases and initialization properly, so that the application is robust and reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application initializes THEN the system SHALL parse the initial hash URL correctly
2. WHEN routes don't match any defined pattern THEN the system SHALL handle parsing failures gracefully with a default route
3. WHEN handling route changes THEN the system SHALL subscribe to hash change events reliably
4. WHEN programmatically navigating THEN the system SHALL provide commands for changing routes
5. WHEN the hash URL is malformed THEN the system SHALL fallback to the default route without errors
6. WHEN multiple rapid navigation events occur THEN the system SHALL handle them without race conditions
