# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will implement URL-based routing for the Elm application, allowing users to navigate directly to specific pages via URLs and enabling browser back/forward navigation. The application currently has a basic page-based routing system but lacks URL integration, which limits user experience and prevents deep linking to specific sections.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to navigate directly to specific pages using URLs, so that I can bookmark and share links to different sections of the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the root URL "/" THEN the system SHALL redirect to "/landing"
2. WHEN a user visits "/landing" THEN the system SHALL display the landing page
3. WHEN a user visits "/tic-tac-toe" THEN the system SHALL display the tic-tac-toe game page
4. WHEN a user visits "/robot-game" THEN the system SHALL display the robot grid game page
5. WHEN a user visits "/style-guide" THEN the system SHALL display the style guide page
6. WHEN a user visits an invalid URL THEN the system SHALL redirect to "/landing"

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to use browser navigation (back/forward buttons), so that I can navigate through the application history naturally.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to a different page THEN the browser URL SHALL update to reflect the current page
2. WHEN a user clicks the browser back button THEN the system SHALL navigate to the previous page
3. WHEN a user clicks the browser forward button THEN the system SHALL navigate to the next page in history
4. WHEN navigating via browser buttons THEN the application state SHALL be preserved appropriately

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to maintain game state when navigating between pages, so that I don't lose my progress when switching views.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates away from a game page THEN the game state SHALL be preserved
2. WHEN a user returns to a game page THEN the previous game state SHALL be restored
3. WHEN a user navigates between pages THEN the theme preference SHALL be maintained
4. WHEN a user refreshes the page THEN the current page SHALL be determined from the URL

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the routing system to be extensible, so that new pages can be easily added in the future.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adding a new page THEN the routing system SHALL require minimal changes to existing code
2. WHEN defining routes THEN the system SHALL use a centralized route definition
3. WHEN parsing URLs THEN the system SHALL handle route parameters if needed in the future
4. WHEN generating URLs THEN the system SHALL provide helper functions for type-safe URL construction

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want navigation links to update the URL without full page reloads, so that the application feels responsive and maintains state.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN clicking navigation links THEN the system SHALL use pushState navigation
2. WHEN navigating between pages THEN the page SHALL not reload completely
3. WHEN the URL changes THEN only the relevant page content SHALL update
4. WHEN navigation occurs THEN the browser history SHALL be updated appropriately
