# Design Document

## Overview

This design outlines the integration of elm-program-test into the existing Elm project to enable comprehensive end-to-end integration testing. elm-program-test provides a framework for testing complete Elm applications by simulating user interactions, testing navigation flows, and verifying complex state transitions. The integration will complement the existing unit tests with full application workflow testing.

## Architecture

### Testing Framework Integration

The elm-program-test framework will be integrated alongside the existing elm-explorations/test framework:

```
Testing Architecture:
├── Unit Tests (elm-explorations/test)
│   ├── Individual module testing
│   ├── Function-level testing
│   └── Component isolation testing
└── Integration Tests (elm-program-test)
    ├── End-to-end user workflows
    ├── Multi-component interactions
    └── Application-level state testing
```

### Test Organization Structure

Integration tests will follow the existing project structure but be clearly distinguished:

```
tests/
├── Integration/
│   ├── TicTacToe/
│   │   ├── GameFlowIntegrationTest.elm
│   │   ├── AIInteractionIntegrationTest.elm
│   │   └── ThemeIntegrationTest.elm
│   │   └── TicTacToeProgramTestHelpers.elm
│   ├── RobotGame/
│   │   ├── NavigationIntegrationTest.elm
│   │   ├── UserInputIntegrationTest.elm
│   │   └── AnimationIntegrationTest.elm
│   │   └── RobotGameProgramTestHelpers.elm
│   ├── App/
│   │   ├── RoutingIntegrationTest.elm
│   │   ├── NavigationFlowIntegrationTest.elm
│   │   └── StatePreservationIntegrationTest.elm
│   └── TestUtils/
│       ├── ProgramTestHelpers.elm
└── [existing unit tests...]
```

## Components and Interfaces

### 1. Test Utilities Module

**Purpose:** Provide reusable utilities for elm-program-test setup and common operations.

**Interface:**
```elm
module TestUtils.ProgramTestHelpers exposing
    ( startApp
    , startTicTacToe
    , startRobotGame
    , simulateClick
    , simulateKeyPress
    , expectGameState
    , expectRobotPosition
    , expectRoute
    )

-- Helper functions for common test operations
startApp : () -> ProgramTest App.Model App.Msg (Cmd App.Msg)
startTicTacToe : () -> ProgramTest TicTacToe.Model TicTacToe.Msg (Cmd TicTacToe.Msg)
simulateClick : String -> ProgramTest model msg effect -> ProgramTest model msg effect
```

### 2. TicTacToe Integration Tests

**Components:**
- **GameFlowIntegrationTest:** Complete game workflows from start to finish
- **AIInteractionIntegrationTest:** Human-AI interaction patterns
- **ThemeIntegrationTest:** Theme switching during gameplay

**Key Test Scenarios:**
- Complete game from first move to win/draw
- AI response timing and correctness
- Theme persistence across game states
- Reset functionality
- Error handling and recovery

### 3. RobotGame Integration Tests

**Components:**
- **NavigationIntegrationTest:** Robot movement and boundary interactions
- **UserInputIntegrationTest:** Keyboard and button input handling
- **AnimationIntegrationTest:** Animation state transitions

**Key Test Scenarios:**
- Complete navigation sequences
- Boundary collision handling
- Animation timing and state management
- Input validation and response
- Theme changes during gameplay

### 4. Application-Level Integration Tests

**Components:**
- **RoutingIntegrationTest:** URL routing and page transitions
- **NavigationFlowIntegrationTest:** Multi-page user journeys
- **StatePreservationIntegrationTest:** State persistence across navigation

**Key Test Scenarios:**
- Landing page to game navigation
- Game state preservation during navigation
- URL synchronization with application state
- Back/forward browser navigation
- Deep linking functionality

## Data Models

### Test Configuration Types

```elm
type alias TestConfig =
    { timeout : Int
    , skipAnimations : Bool
    , mockWorkers : Bool
    }

type alias GameTestState =
    { expectedBoard : Board
    , expectedPlayer : Player
    , expectedGameState : GameState
    }

type alias RobotTestState =
    { expectedPosition : Position
    , expectedFacing : Direction
    , expectedAnimationState : AnimationState
    }
```

### Test Assertion Helpers

```elm
type TestAssertion
    = ExpectText String
    | ExpectElementPresent String
    | ExpectElementAbsent String
    | ExpectModelState (model -> Expectation)
    | ExpectRoute Route
```

## Error Handling

### Test Failure Scenarios

1. **Timeout Handling:** Tests that involve animations or async operations will have configurable timeouts
2. **Element Not Found:** Clear error messages when expected UI elements are missing
3. **State Mismatch:** Detailed reporting when application state doesn't match expectations
4. **Worker Communication:** Handling of web worker communication failures in tests

### Error Recovery Strategies

```elm
-- Retry mechanism for flaky operations
retryOperation : Int -> (() -> ProgramTest model msg effect) -> ProgramTest model msg effect

-- Graceful handling of timing-sensitive operations
waitForCondition : (model -> Bool) -> ProgramTest model msg effect -> ProgramTest model msg effect

-- Mock worker responses for deterministic testing
mockWorkerResponse : Json.Value -> ProgramTest model msg effect -> ProgramTest model msg effect
```

## Testing Strategy

### Test Categories

1. **Happy Path Tests:** Standard user workflows that should always work
2. **Edge Case Tests:** Boundary conditions and unusual input combinations
3. **Error Condition Tests:** How the application handles and recovers from errors
4. **Performance Tests:** Ensuring responsive behavior under normal conditions

### Test Data Management

```elm
-- Predefined game states for testing
testGameStates : 
    { initial : GameState
    , midGame : GameState
    , nearWin : GameState
    , winner : GameState
    , draw : GameState
    }

-- Robot positions for boundary testing
testRobotPositions :
    { center : Position
    , corners : List Position
    , edges : List Position
    }
```

### Mocking Strategy

1. **Time Mocking:** Control time progression for animation and timeout testing
2. **Worker Mocking:** Mock web worker responses for deterministic AI behavior
3. **Random Mocking:** Control random number generation for predictable test outcomes
4. **Browser API Mocking:** Mock browser APIs like localStorage and window dimensions

## Integration Points

### With Existing Test Suite

- Integration tests will run as part of the standard `npm run test` command
- Test results will be clearly categorized (unit vs integration)
- Shared test utilities will be available to both test types
- Coverage reporting will include both test types

### With Build Process

- elm-program-test will be added to elm.json test-dependencies
- No changes required to build scripts
- Integration tests will respect existing timeout configurations
- Test artifacts will be cleaned up with existing cleanup processes

### With CI/CD Pipeline

- Integration tests will run in the same CI environment as unit tests
- Test parallelization will be considered for performance
- Failure reporting will distinguish between test types
- Coverage thresholds will account for integration test coverage

## Performance Considerations

### Test Execution Speed

- Use of `ProgramTest.clickButton` and similar helpers for efficient interaction simulation
- Selective animation skipping for faster test execution
- Parallel test execution where possible
- Efficient test data setup and teardown

### Resource Management

- Proper cleanup of test instances
- Memory management for long-running test suites
- Efficient DOM manipulation during tests
- Controlled worker lifecycle during testing

## Security Considerations

- No sensitive data exposure in test configurations
- Secure handling of mock data
- Isolation between test runs
- No production API calls during testing
