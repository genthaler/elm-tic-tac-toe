# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will integrate elm-program-test into the existing Elm project to enable comprehensive end-to-end integration testing. elm-program-test allows testing complete user interactions with Elm applications, including simulating user input, testing navigation flows, and verifying complex state transitions across multiple components. This will enhance the current testing suite by providing capabilities to test complete user workflows that span multiple components and involve real user interactions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to add elm-program-test as a testing dependency, so that I can write comprehensive integration tests for complete user workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN elm-program-test is added to the project THEN it SHALL be included in the elm.json test-dependencies
2. WHEN the project builds THEN elm-program-test SHALL be available for import in test modules
3. WHEN tests run THEN elm-program-test SHALL not conflict with existing elm-explorations/test framework
4. WHEN elm-program-test is imported THEN it SHALL provide ProgramTest module functionality

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to create end-to-end tests for the TicTacToe game, so that I can verify complete game workflows from user input to final game state.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on a cell THEN the test SHALL verify the cell is marked with the correct player symbol
2. WHEN a user completes a winning sequence THEN the test SHALL verify the winner is displayed correctly
3. WHEN the AI makes a move THEN the test SHALL verify the AI response appears on the board
4. WHEN a user resets the game THEN the test SHALL verify the board returns to initial state
5. WHEN a user toggles the color scheme THEN the test SHALL verify the theme changes are applied
6. WHEN the game reaches a draw state THEN the test SHALL verify the draw message is displayed

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to create end-to-end tests for the Robot Game, so that I can verify complete navigation workflows and user interactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user presses arrow keys THEN the test SHALL verify the robot moves or rotates correctly
2. WHEN a user clicks movement buttons THEN the test SHALL verify the robot responds appropriately
3. WHEN the robot hits a boundary THEN the test SHALL verify blocked movement feedback is shown
4. WHEN a user changes the color scheme THEN the test SHALL verify the visual theme updates
5. WHEN the robot completes a movement sequence THEN the test SHALL verify the final position is correct
6. WHEN animations are triggered THEN the test SHALL verify animation states transition properly

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to create end-to-end tests for the main application navigation, so that I can verify routing and page transitions work correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates from landing page to a game THEN the test SHALL verify the correct game loads
2. WHEN a user navigates back to landing page THEN the test SHALL verify the landing page displays correctly
3. WHEN URL changes occur THEN the test SHALL verify the correct page is rendered
4. WHEN navigation state is preserved THEN the test SHALL verify game state persists during navigation
5. WHEN invalid routes are accessed THEN the test SHALL verify appropriate error handling

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to test complex user workflows that span multiple components, so that I can ensure the entire application works cohesively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user completes a full game session THEN the test SHALL verify all components interact correctly
2. WHEN multiple user interactions occur in sequence THEN the test SHALL verify state consistency
3. WHEN error conditions are triggered THEN the test SHALL verify proper error handling and recovery
4. WHEN time-dependent features are used THEN the test SHALL verify timing-related functionality
5. WHEN web worker communication occurs THEN the test SHALL verify worker integration works correctly

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want integration tests to run alongside existing unit tests, so that I can maintain a comprehensive testing strategy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN npm run test is executed THEN integration tests SHALL run with existing unit tests
2. WHEN tests fail THEN integration test failures SHALL be clearly distinguishable from unit test failures
3. WHEN CI/CD runs THEN integration tests SHALL not significantly impact build time
4. WHEN test coverage is measured THEN integration tests SHALL contribute to overall coverage metrics
5. WHEN tests are organized THEN integration tests SHALL follow existing project structure conventions

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive test utilities and helpers, so that I can write maintainable and reusable integration tests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN writing integration tests THEN common test utilities SHALL be available for reuse
2. WHEN testing user interactions THEN helper functions SHALL simplify common interaction patterns
3. WHEN verifying application state THEN assertion helpers SHALL provide clear error messages
4. WHEN testing async operations THEN utilities SHALL handle timing and worker communication
5. WHEN tests need setup THEN helper functions SHALL provide consistent test initialization
