# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Robot Grid Game is an interactive control game where users can navigate a robot on a 5x5 grid using directional movement and rotation controls. The robot maintains a facing direction and can move forward in that direction or rotate to face any of the four cardinal directions (North, South, East, West). The game provides both keyboard controls for efficient gameplay and visual button controls for accessibility and mobile compatibility.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a player, I want to see a robot positioned on a 5x5 grid, so that I can understand the game environment and the robot's current location.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game loads THEN the system SHALL display a 5x5 grid with clearly defined boundaries
2. WHEN the game loads THEN the system SHALL place a robot at a default starting position on the grid
3. WHEN the robot is displayed THEN the system SHALL show a visual indicator of which direction the robot is facing
4. WHEN the grid is displayed THEN the system SHALL clearly distinguish between occupied and empty grid cells

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a player, I want to move the robot forward in the direction it is facing, so that I can navigate the robot around the grid.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the player presses the forward movement control THEN the system SHALL move the robot one cell forward in its current facing direction
2. WHEN the robot is at the edge of the grid AND the player attempts to move forward THEN the system SHALL prevent the movement and keep the robot in its current position
3. WHEN the robot moves forward THEN the system SHALL update the visual display to show the robot's new position
4. WHEN the robot moves THEN the system SHALL maintain the robot's current facing direction

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a player, I want to rotate the robot to face different cardinal directions, so that I can control which direction the robot will move forward.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the player uses rotation controls THEN the system SHALL rotate the robot to face North, South, East, or West
2. WHEN the robot rotates THEN the system SHALL update the visual indicator to show the new facing direction
3. WHEN the robot rotates THEN the system SHALL keep the robot in its current grid position
4. WHEN the player rotates the robot THEN the system SHALL provide smooth visual feedback for the direction change

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a player, I want to use keyboard controls to move and rotate the robot, so that I can play the game efficiently with familiar input methods.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the player presses the up arrow key THEN the system SHALL move the robot forward in its facing direction
2. WHEN the player presses the left arrow key THEN the system SHALL rotate the robot to face left relative to its current direction
3. WHEN the player presses the right arrow key THEN the system SHALL rotate the robot to face right relative to its current direction
4. WHEN the player presses the down arrow key THEN the system SHALL rotate the robot to face the opposite direction
5. WHEN keyboard controls are used THEN the system SHALL provide immediate visual feedback

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a player, I want to use visual button controls to move and rotate the robot, so that I can play the game on touch devices or when keyboard input is not available.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game interface loads THEN the system SHALL display clearly labeled control buttons for movement and rotation
2. WHEN the player clicks the forward button THEN the system SHALL move the robot forward in its facing direction
3. WHEN the player clicks rotation buttons THEN the system SHALL rotate the robot in the specified direction
4. WHEN control buttons are clicked THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback to confirm the action
5. WHEN buttons are displayed THEN the system SHALL make them accessible and appropriately sized for touch interaction

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a player, I want clear visual feedback about the robot's state and position, so that I can understand the current game situation and plan my next moves.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the robot is displayed THEN the system SHALL show a distinct visual representation that clearly indicates it is a robot
2. WHEN the robot faces a direction THEN the system SHALL display an arrow, orientation marker, or similar indicator showing the facing direction
3. WHEN the robot moves or rotates THEN the system SHALL provide smooth animations or transitions
4. WHEN the robot cannot move forward THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback indicating the blocked movement
5. WHEN the game state changes THEN the system SHALL update all visual elements immediately and consistently
