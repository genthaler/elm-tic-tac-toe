  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 3.1, 3.3_

- [x] 3. Create basic grid visualization and robot rendering
  - Create `src/RobotGame/View.elm` with 5x5 grid rendering using elm-ui
  - Implement robot visualization with clear directional indicator (arrow or similar)
  - Create theme-aware styling that integrates with existing ColorScheme system
  - Write visual tests to verify grid and robot display correctly
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 6.1, 6.2_

- [x] 4. Implement game initialization and update logic
  - Create `src/RobotGame/Main.elm` with init, update, and subscriptions functions
  - Implement message handling for MoveForward, RotateLeft, RotateRight, and RotateToDirection
  - Add proper state management for robot position and facing direction updates

  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.3, 3.1, 3.2_

- [x] 5. Add visual control buttons for movement and rotation
  - Implement forward movement button in View.elm with proper styling and accessibility
  - Create rotation control buttons (left, right, and directional buttons)
  - Add button state management (enabled/disabled based on movement validity)
  - Implement touch-friendly button sizing and hover/press visual feedback
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5_

- [x] 6. Implement keyboard input handling
  - Add keyboard event subscriptions in Main.elm for arrow key detection
  - Map arrow keys to appropriate game actions (up=forward, left/right=rotate, down=opposite)
  - Implement key event filtering to handle only relevant keyboard input
  - Write tests for keyboard input translation to game messages
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5_

- [x] 7. Add movement validation and visual feedback for blocked actions
  - Implement boundary checking in update function to prevent invalid moves
  - Add visual feedback when robot cannot move forward (button disabled state, subtle animation)
  - Ensure robot position and facing direction remain unchanged for blocked movements
  - Create visual indicators for blocked movement attempts
  - _Requirements: 2.2, 6.4_

- [x] 8. Implement smooth animations for movement and rotation
  - Add AnimationState type and animation management to Model.elm
  - Create smooth transition animations for robot movement between grid cells
  - Implement rotation animations with visual direction indicator changes
  - Add animation completion handling to prevent input during transitions
  - _Requirements: 6.3, 6.5_

- [x] 9. Integrate robot game with main application routing
  - Update `src/App.elm` to include RobotGamePage in Page type
  - Add navigation messages and routing logic for robot game
  - Implement robot game model management in main app state
  - Add robot game message handling in main app update function
  - _Requirements: 1.1_

- [x] 10. Update landing page to include robot game option
  - Modify `src/Landing/Landing.elm` to add PlayRobotGameClicked message
  - Update `src/Landing/LandingView.elm` to display robot game navigation button
  - Implement navigation from landing page to robot game
  - Style robot game button consistently with existing landing page design
  - _Requirements: 1.1_

- [x] 11. Add responsive design and theme integration
  - Implement responsive grid sizing based on window dimensions in View.elm
  - Integrate robot game with existing ColorScheme theme system
  - Add proper theme-aware colors for grid, robot, and controls
  - Test robot game appearance in both light and dark themes
  - _Requirements: 6.1, 6.2, 6.5_

- [x] 12. Create comprehensive test suite
  - Write unit tests for all core game logic functions in RobotGame.elm
  - Create integration tests for complete user interaction flows
  - Add visual regression tests for grid and robot rendering
  - Implement keyboard input testing for all control scenarios
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 3.1, 3.2, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 5.2, 5.3_

- [x] 13. Polish user experience and accessibility
  - Add proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation support for visual controls
  - Implement smooth visual transitions and hover states for all interactive elements
  - Add visual feedback for successful moves and blocked attempts
  - Ensure consistent visual design with existing application components
  - _Requirements: 5.4, 5.5, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5_
