# Product Overview


## Tic-tac-toe

A Tic-Tac-Toe game built with Elm that demonstrates functional programming concepts and immutable state management. The game features:

- Interactive turn-based gameplay between human and AI players
- AI opponent using negamax algorithm with game theory implementations
- Web worker architecture to handle AI computations without blocking the UI
- Clean functional architecture with immutable state
- Responsive design with elm-ui

The project serves as both a playable game and an educational example of functional programming patterns, game theory algorithms, and Elm architecture best practices.

## Robot game

- The Robot Grid Game is an interactive control game where users can navigate a robot on a 5x5 grid using directional movement and rotation controls. 
- The robot maintains a facing direction and can move forward in that direction or rotate to face any of the four cardinal directions (North, South, East, West).
- The game provides both keyboard controls for efficient gameplay and visual button controls for accessibility and mobile compatibility.
