# Product Overview

Elm TTT is a Tic-Tac-Toe game built with Elm that demonstrates functional programming concepts and immutable state management. The game features:

- Interactive turn-based gameplay between human and AI players
- AI opponent using negamax algorithm with game theory implementations
- Web worker architecture to handle AI computations without blocking the UI
- Clean functional architecture with immutable state
- Responsive design with elm-ui
- Component style guide using elm-book

The project serves as both a playable game and an educational example of functional programming patterns, game theory algorithms, and Elm architecture best practices.
