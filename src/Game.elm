{-| For minimax, here are the required parameters

  - Â´depthÂ´ -- how deep to search from this node;
  - `maximizingPlayer` -- whose point of view we're searching from;
  - `heuristic` -- a function that returns an approximate value of the current position;
  - `getChildren` -- a function that generates valid positions from the current position;
  - `node` -- the current position.

For tic-tac-toe, these correspond to

  - depth - 9; that's as long as the game can go
  - heuristic - in rank, the best is a winning position, followed by number of open winning positions, followed by postions on an empty line, else 0
  - getChildren - if it's your go, you can go anywhere
