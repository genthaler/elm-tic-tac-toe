module ProductionHashRoutingTest exposing (suite)

{-| Production build hash routing verification tests.

This module contains tests to verify that hash routing works correctly in production builds,
covering direct hash URL access, bookmark functionality, and refresh behavior.

Requirements covered:

  - 1.1: Navigate directly to specific pages using hash URLs
  - 1.2: Direct access to landing page via hash URLs
  - 1.3: Direct access to tic-tac-toe page via hash URLs
  - 1.4: Direct access to robot game page via hash URLs
  - 1.5: Direct access to style guide page via hash URLs
  - 3.4: Current page determined from URL on refresh

This test module focuses on the production build requirements and verifies
that the built application handles hash routing correctly.
